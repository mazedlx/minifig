## Laravel Minifigs
The name says it all: a web app to organize your minifigs. Based on Laravel. Simple as that.

### Documentation
Documentation for the Laravel framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
There is no special documentation for the Minifigs application itself. Create a database with utf8-unicode-ci encoding, create an .env file, and add your database settings to it.Run the migrations with
```shell
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
```
This will create some sample data.
